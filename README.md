# Regression-project
Developed a 'Football Player Recommendation' project leveraging machine learning techniques. 
Utilized Python, data preprocessing, and collaborative filtering algorithms to analyze players' performance data and preferences. 
Created a personalized recommendation system that suggests suitable football players for specific team roles.


**Abstract**:

This paper proposes a football player recommendation system based on player statistics and team needs. The system utilizes a machine learning algorithm to analyze player performance data and identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for each position on the field. The KPIs are used to evaluate players and generate a personalized ranking for each position based on their skill set. The team’s needs are then analyzed to determine the most suitable players to fill the gaps in the team’s lineup. The system provides an easy-to-use interface that allows coaches and managers to search for players by position and receive a list of recommended players based on their team’s needs. The proposed system has the potential to save time and resources in player scouting and recruitment, as well as improve team performance by selecting the best-fit players for each position.

**Introduction**:

Football is the most popular sport in the world and has been since the beginning of the 20th century. As a result of that the sport has seen a significant rise in the number of players, making the job of the scouts and managers much harder than it was before. Currently, there are more than 250 million players in the world looking for opportunities to make it as professional footballers. The game of football works best when all the eleven positions on the pitch are being covered by the players having the skillsets of the required positions. In the era of modern football where there are too many players to choose from, this job becomes incredibly tough without seeking technological assistance. In this paper, we discuss the steps involved in developing a machine-learning model that aides the management in recruiting a player, especially when there is a vacant spot in the squad. We take into account the player’s market value or release clause, health condition, skillset, experience, and various other factors while recommending a particular player to the manager. The machine learning model also predicts the market value and performance of the target player in the future so that the manager and the club can make a well-informed decision and invest in the right player.
